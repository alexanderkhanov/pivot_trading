# Pivot trading

This is an interface to my stock trading project. It takes data from four directories, serving as a database:

- history: historical daily stock data in csv format, as downloaded from yahoo
- scrap: additional daily stock data in the same format as history
- scratch: last minute stock data
- dataline: trading algorithm decisions based on data above
